# Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks for PhD Students in MOD group, KU Leuven

This repository serves as a hands-on tutorial for introducing the neural networks to Ph.D. students PMA in MOD Breakfast meeting on 8th April 2019. You can find the presentation presented in the meeting [here](./A hands-on Intro to Neural Networks.pptx).

## Subfolders
There are several examples listed in the repository.

1. 0th example: A basic example in which a single layer neural network learns a logical operation from a small dataset. 
2. 1th example: A single layer neural network is trained to predict a hand written images from MNIST dataset.
3. 2th example: A LeNet architecture convolutional neural networks with fully connected classifier detects the traffic signs from a [German traffic sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
4. MNIST: A LeNet architecture convolutional neural networks with fully connected classifier is trained to predict a hand written images from MNIST dataset.
5. notMNIST: A single layer neural network is used to predict animated letters in notMNIST dataset.
